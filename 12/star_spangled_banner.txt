THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER

OH SAY CAN YOU SEE BY THE DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT
WHAT SO PROUDLY WE HAIL'D AT THE TWILIGHT'S LAST GLEAMING
WHOSE BROAD STRIPES AND BRIGHT STARS THRO' THE PERILOUS FIGHT
O'ER THE RAMPARTS WE WATCH'D WERE SO GALLANTLY STREAMING
AND THE ROCKETS' RED GLARE THE BOMBS BURSTING IN AIR
GAVE PROOF THRO' THE NIGHT THAT OUR FLAG WAS STILL THERE
O SAY DOES THAT STAR SPANGLED BANNER YET WAVE
O'ER THE LAND OF THE FREE AND THE HOME OF THE BRAVE
